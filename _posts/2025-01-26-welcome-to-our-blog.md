Welcome to the official Saguaro blog! We're excited to share our journey building **Gatekeeper**, the MEV protection solution for Solana.

## What is Gatekeeper?

Gatekeeper is our solution to stop sandwich attacks on Solana - **fee-free and fully onchain**. Think of it as Cloudflare for Solana, protecting users from malicious MEV by avoiding bad validators.

### Key Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **MEV Protection**: Prevent sandwich attacks by avoiding malicious validators
- üîß **Simple Integration**: One CPI call is all it takes
- üí∞ **Fee-free**: No additional costs for protection
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Fully Onchain**: All logic runs on Solana

## Why We Built This

The Solana ecosystem has grown tremendously, but with that growth comes new challenges. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks, particularly sandwich attacks, have become a significant problem for traders and DeFi users.

> Traditional MEV protection solutions often involve off-chain components or additional fees. We wanted to build something different - a fully onchain solution that's free to use.

## What's Next?

In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing:

- Technical deep dives into how Gatekeeper works
- Integration guides for developers
- Updates on our mainnet deployment
- Insights from our research into MEV on Solana
